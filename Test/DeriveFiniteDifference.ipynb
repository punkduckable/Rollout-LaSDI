    "Further, notice that when $a = b = c = h$, we have $c_{-1} = 1/h^2, c_0 = -2/h^2, c_1 = 1/h^2$ and $c_2 = 0$, which are the usual $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ central difference coefficients for a uniformly spaced time grid. \n",
    "Note that these coefficients are of order $\\mathcal{O}(1/h^2)$ as long as there are $m, M > 0$ such that $a, b, c \\in [m, M]$. \n",

    "We could attempt to derive a $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ central difference rule using $f(x - a - b)$, $f(x - b)$, $f(x + c)$, and $f(x + c + d)$, but the resulting system of equations is considerably harder to solve. Thus, we stick with the two methods derived above. "
